Jamming - React Spotify Playlist Creator
Project Overview
Jamming is a React-based web application that allows users to search for songs using the Spotify API, create custom playlists, and save them to their Spotify account. This project was developed as a learning experience to practice and demonstrate various React concepts and skills.
What I Learned
Through the development of this project, I gained hands-on experience with several key React concepts and related technologies:

React Components and Props: I learned how to structure a React application using functional components (e.g., App, SearchBar, Results, Playlist) and pass data between them using props.
State Management: I used the useState hook to manage local component state, such as search results, playlist tracks, and form inputs.
Side Effects: The useEffect hook was employed to handle side effects, like updating the playlist name when it changes.
Event Handling: I implemented various event handlers to manage user interactions, such as searching for tracks, adding tracks to a playlist, and saving playlists.
Conditional Rendering: The application uses conditional rendering to display search results or a message when no tracks are found.
API Integration: I learned how to integrate with external APIs (Spotify API) using async/await and the Fetch API to perform CRUD operations.
Material-UI (MUI): I gained experience using a popular React UI framework to create a responsive and visually appealing interface.
CSS-in-JS: Through MUI's sx prop, I learned how to apply styles directly to components using JavaScript objects.
React Hooks: Besides useState and useEffect, I got familiar with the concept of custom hooks for reusable stateful logic.
Error Handling: I implemented basic error handling for API requests and displayed user-friendly messages.
Performance Optimization: I used techniques like filtering out duplicate tracks to improve the user experience.
Git Version Control: Throughout the project, I practiced using Git for version control and collaborating on GitHub.
